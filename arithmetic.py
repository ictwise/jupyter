# Exercise 1: Carry out the following calculations, and use print() to view your answers.

# For example: for 3 x 5 the syntax (way of writing) would be:

print(3 * 5)

print(3 -5)

+
-
/
*
** 
%

print(5 % 2)


# a) 20 subtract 5



# b) 7 added to 6

# c) 13 multiplied by 5 

# d) 36 divided by 6 

# e) 13 to the power of 3 (Exponentiation raises the number to the left to the power of the number to the right)

# f) 51 modulo 7 (This operator returns the remainder from division of the two numbers)

# g) Experiment with using parenthesis (curved brackets) to change the order of operations:

# for example try 5*8-5 and compare the answer to 5*(8-5)

# Note, you should see with your answer to g) that any calculation in brackets happens before any other calculation

print(5*8-5)

print(5*(8-5))

#### Optional extras #####

# h) Calculate 57.45/9.765;


# i) Use the round() function to round your answer to h)



# i) See if you can adjust the round function to round to 1 decimal place (you might have to google this)
